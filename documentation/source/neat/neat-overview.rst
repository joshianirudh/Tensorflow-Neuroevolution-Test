NEAT Overview
=============

**[WORK IN PROGRESS]**

The NeuroEvolution of Augmemting Topologies (NEAT) method was introduced in 2002 by Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen and refined in 2 subsequent publications. These publications are listed below. NEATs basic idea is to start out with a minimal densely connected neural network and add a single or multiple neurons each generation, upon which each member of the population discerns itself more and more from the other members of the population. This allows the population to form clusters of similar population members, called species, that ideally each represent a different approach to the problem. This in turn then allows the algorithm to identify which approach to the problem works well and promote the further exploration of the according species.
