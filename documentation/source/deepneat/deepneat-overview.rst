DeepNEAT Overview
=================

**[WORK IN PROGRESS]**

The Deep NeuroEvolution of Augmemting Topologies (DeepNEAT) method was first introduced in 2017 by a Team of researchers from Sentient Technologies and the University of Texas at Austin. The paper was named 'Evolving Deep Neural Networks' and introduced mainly the CoDeepNEAT method, though did so by first drafting the DeepNEAT method without going in too much detail, leaving much of the intricacies to the implementation. DeepNEATs underlying idea is to transfer the proven concepts of NEAT to the deep learning context. DeepNEAT carries over the proven concepts of complexifying the initially minimal population, protecting innovation through speciation and promoting beneficial features represented by certain species. Those concepts however are now applied to a graph of deep learning layers instead of a graph of single neurons as used by NEAT.
