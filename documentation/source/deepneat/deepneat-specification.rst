DeepNEAT Specification
======================

.. note:: This documentation solely lists the algorithm & encoding specifications without concerning itself with the validity or potential of the specific choices that make up the DeepNEAT method.

.. warning::  This documentation outlines the DeepNEAT algorithm & encoding specifications as understood by the TFNE project. While the TFNE project aims to stay as close as possible to the original specification, does it also aim to be a superset of the configuration options of the original specification. This specification also concretizes the algorithm specification if the original specification is too vague and no code was supplied. If you find an issue with the specification or the implementation details please contact tfne@paulpauls.de. Thank you.


**[WORK IN PROGRESS]**

This page will cover:

* Implementation details
* algorithms specifics that are possibly not covered by author
* video on implementation
* exact list of config options for implementation
* etc
